Chess Insights is a tool that uses the chess.com api to export all user data to a 
csv file. It also has home data visualization tools that are still a work in progress. 
Some data points might not be available depending on your account type, account creation date 
or the API simply not publishing said data. For example game accuracy evaluations will 
only be available to games you have analyzed and individual move evaluations 
such as `brilliant` or `blunder` are not made public. 

### Ignored game modes 
The only game modes fetched from the api are `bullet`, `blitz`, `rapid`, and `daily`
- `bughouse`
- `crazyhouse`
- `threecheck`
- `chess960`
- `kingofthehill`

reduce the amount of unnecessary requests made.
